Upload and manage images
========================

A virtual machine image, referred to in this document simply
as an image, is a single file that contains a virtual disk that
has a bootable operating system installed on it. Images are used
to create virtual machine instances within the cloud. For information
about creating image files, see the `OpenStack Virtual Machine
Image Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/>`_.

Depending on your role, you may have permission to upload and manage
virtual machine images. Operators might restrict the upload and
management of images to cloud administrators or operators only. If you
have the appropriate privileges, you can use the dashboard to upload and
manage images in the admin project.

.. note::

   You can also use the :command:`openstack` and :command:`glance`
   command-line clients or the Image service to manage images.
