    <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/network-bandwidth-limiting-qos>`_]
    Add partial support for Network QoS policies. Since the panel is incomplete
    in Pike, it is disabled by default. It can be enabled in the file
    `openstack_dashboard/enabled/_1510_project_network_qos_panel.py`. When
    enabled, this panel allows users to view a list of created network
    policies. This panel displays a table view of the name, description
    and shared status of each policy. The details page for each policy also
    shows information on the associated rules.
