    (For Horizon plugin developers) The AVAIL_CHANGED event of transfer
    table is removed. It is superseded by event TABLES_CHANGED. The
    name of AVAIL_CHANGED was misleading because it implicitly and
    uncontrollably updated the allocated table too. The new event allows
    independent updates to all four tables. We believe it is safe to
    remove AVAIL_CHANGED without deprecation because its implementation
    contained a bug that must have been discovered before if anybody
    had used it. Anyway possible out-of-tree plugin maintainers are
    recommended to consume the new event even if your plugins relied on
    the buggy behavior of AVAIL_CHANGED.
