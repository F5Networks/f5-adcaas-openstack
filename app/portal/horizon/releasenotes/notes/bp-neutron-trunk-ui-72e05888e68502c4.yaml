    [`blueprint neutron-trunk-ui <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/neutron-trunk-ui>`_]
    Add partial support for Neutron Trunks. Since the panel is incomplete
    in Pike, it is disabled by default. It can be enabled in the file
    'openstack_dashboard/enabled/_1500_project_trunks_panel.py'. After
    enabling it the Project/Network/Trunks panel turns on if Neutron
    API extension 'trunk' is available. It displays information about
    trunks. The details page for each trunk also shows information about
    subports of that trunk. Currently supported actions: delete.
