features:
  - The hard-coded run_tests commands for extracting translatable strings and
    updating message catalogs have been ported to django management commands
    as extract_messages and update_catalog. These accept several parameters
    to make them easier to use with downstream customisations and string
    modifications, but the default behaviour is the same as before.
deprecations:
  - The run_tests.sh script is now deprecated and all functionality has
    been provided by either tox or manage.py. run_tests will be removed
    in Queens (13.0).
