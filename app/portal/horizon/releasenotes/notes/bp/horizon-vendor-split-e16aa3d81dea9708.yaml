upgrade:
  - The ``profile_support`` setting has been removed from the
    ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK`` dict, and any usages have been removed from
    the Horizon code base. If you were relying on this being set by default,
    you will now need to manually set the value in your plugin/customisation.
