    Heat dashboard is now split out into a separate project
    ``heat-dashboard``. All new features and maintenances are
    provided from the new project from now on. The new project provides
    all features available in Horizon in the past release.
    To continue to use heat dashboard, install ``heat-dashboard``
    and set up the horizon plugin configuration file in ``enabled`` directory.
    For more information, see ``heat-dashboard`` documentation
