    Unnecessary API calls to back-end services are eliminated when checking
    the quota and usage in individual panels. Each panel checks a resource
    can be created by retrieving the current quota and usage for the resource.
    However, the previous implementation retrieves quota and usage of unrelated
    resources (For example, Nova usage is retrieved when checking a network
    usage). It can be a performance problem in large deployments.
    This behavior is now fixed to load quota and usage only for resources
    which are really required.
