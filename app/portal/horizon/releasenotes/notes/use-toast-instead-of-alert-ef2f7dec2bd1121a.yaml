    In an effort to establish Angular conventions,
    use the framework's toastService rather than the
    legacy horizon.alert(...) in client-side code.
    horizon.alert is still used by the django messaging
    framework, so horizon.messages.js still exists.
deprecations:
  - All previous instances of horizon.alert(...) used by
    client-side have been replaced with horizon.toast.
    Alert messages via horizon.alert(...) should be
    avoided when writing new JavaScript code.
    horizon.toast.add('error', gettext(...)) should be
    used instead.
