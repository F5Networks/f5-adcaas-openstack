    As a result of Admin dashboard reorganization, panel groups of many Admin
    panels have been changed. Operators who customize Admin panels (for example,
    disable some Admin panels) through ``enabled`` directory need to update
    panel groups in ``enabled`` files. Horizon plugin developers and deployers
    may also need to update panel configurations under ``enabled`` directory
    to adapt the new Admin menus.
