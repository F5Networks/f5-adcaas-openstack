    The policy framework in horizon now supports policy directories per
    service. This corresponds to ``policy_dirs`` configuration option
    from "oslo.policy" library. The new setting ``POLICY_DIRS`` was
    introduced. The setting allows to define multiple policy directories
    per service. For example, it is useful for a case where multiple
    projects provide policy files like neutron stadium projects.
    For detail, see `the horizon Setting Reference
    <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/settings.html#policy-dirs>`__.
