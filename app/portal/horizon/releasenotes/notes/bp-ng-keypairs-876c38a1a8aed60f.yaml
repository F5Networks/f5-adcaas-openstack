    [`blueprint ng-keypairs <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/ng-keypairs>`_]
    AngularJS-based Key Pairs panel is added. The features in the legacy
    panel are fully implemented. The Key Pairs panel now may be configured
    to use either the legacy or AngularJS-based codes.
    The ANGULAR_FEATURES setting now allows for a `key_pairs_panel`.
    If set to True, then the AngularJS-Based Key Pairs panel will be used,
    while the Django version will be used if set to False. Default value
    for key_pairs_panel is True.
