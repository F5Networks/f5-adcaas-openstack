    [:bug:`1700325`] Horizon now allows to override an embeded default plugin
    enabled file by specifying an enabled plguin file with a same filename.
    If there are plugin enabled files with a same name both in ``enabled`` and
    ``local/enabled`` directories, the file in ``local/enabled`` will be used
    and the file in ``enabled`` will be ignored now.
    Previously, both files are processed in the order of ``enabled`` and then
    ``local/enabled`` in this case, but this made operators difficult to change
    the order of panels from the default order.

    This is useful when you would like to disable some default panel.
    You can do it by specifying ``DISABLED = True`` in a plugin enabled file
    in ``local/enabled`` directory with a same name.

    This works in most cases, but there is a case where you need to be careful
    when upgrading horizon. If you use ``REMOVE_PANEL`` to remove some default
    panel by putting a plugin enabled file with a same name in
    ``local/enabled`` directory, you now need to use ``DISABLED = True`` or
    change the filename.
