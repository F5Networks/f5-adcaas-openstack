    Securtiy group "Add rule" form now allows to specify 'any' IP protocol
    and 'any' port number (for TCP and UDP protocols). This feature is
    available when neutron is used as a networking back-end.
    You can specify 'any' IP protocol for 'Other Protocol' and ``-1`` means
    'any' IP protocol. You can also see ``All ports`` choice in 'Open Port'
    field in case of TCP or UDP protocol is selected.
