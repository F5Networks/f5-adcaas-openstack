features:
  - The ``virtio-forwarder`` VNIC type has been added to the list of valid
    types that may be set on a port. This requests a low-latency virtio port
    inside the instance, likely backed by hardware acceleration and requires a
    supporting Neutron mechanism driver.
  - The configuration documentation for ``supported_vnic_types`` in
    ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK`` has been updated to help an operator decide
    which VNIC types should be available for users to choose from.
