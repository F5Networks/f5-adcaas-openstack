    ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` setting now has a consistent default value
    and it defaults to ``publicURL``. If you use the default value,
    previously (at least Ocata release) Horizon used ``internalURL`` for
    keystone and ``publicURL`` for other services. The default value is
    now ``publicURL``, so if you want horizon to use ``internalURL`` to
    talk with back-end services, ensure to set ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE``
    to ``internalURL``.
