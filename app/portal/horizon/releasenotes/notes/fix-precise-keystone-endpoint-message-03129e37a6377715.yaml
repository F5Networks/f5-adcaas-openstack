deprecations:
  - The function fix_auth_url_version() should be removed
    from openstack_auth library as soon as Horizon no longer
    needs it. The replacement function is fix_auth_url_version_prefix()
    which returns a fixed url and a boolean flag indicating
    if the url was actually fixed. Having a separate flag
    allows to emit more precise warning messages about
    inconsistencies in Keystone endpoint URL.
