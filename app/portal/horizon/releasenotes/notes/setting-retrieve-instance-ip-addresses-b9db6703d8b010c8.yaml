    A new setting ``OPENSTACK_INSTANCE_RETRIEVE_IP_ADDRESSES`` was introduced
    to control whether IP addresses of servers are retrieved from neutron in
    the project instance table. This setting was introduces to mitigate a
    performance issue in large deployments and setting this to ``False``
    skips the query to neutron. Deployments without floating IP support can
    set this setting to ``False`` for better performance.
    For more detail, see [:bug:`1722417`].
