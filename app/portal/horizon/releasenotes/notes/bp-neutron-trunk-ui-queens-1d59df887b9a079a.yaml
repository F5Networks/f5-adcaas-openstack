    [:blueprint:`neutron-trunk-ui`]
    Neutron trunk feature is now supported. It is supported in both the
    project and admin dashboards.
    The panel will be displayed if Neutron API extension 'trunk' is available.
    It displays information about trunks. The details page for each trunk also
    shows information about subports of that trunk.
