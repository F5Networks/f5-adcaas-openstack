    [:bug:`1337473`] The default quotas of neutron resource for a new project
    are no longer got from the quotas of the current project.
    Neutron did not provide a way to retrieve the default quotas and horizon
    used the quotas of the current project as the default quotas for a new
    project as a workaround. Neutron implemented an API to retrieve default
    quotas since newton and horizon now consumes it.
