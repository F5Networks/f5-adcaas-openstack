    [:blueprint:`drop-nova-network`]
    Horizon nova-network floating IP and security groups supports have been
    dropped in Pike release. nova-network has been marked as deprecated
    in Nova in Newton release and horizon support was dropped in favor of it.
    Neutron now becomes a requirement for floating IP and security groups.
    Other operations on instances which created with nova-network should
    work same as before.
