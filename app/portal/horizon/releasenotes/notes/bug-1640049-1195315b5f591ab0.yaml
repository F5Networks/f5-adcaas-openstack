deprecations:
  - The initScope method for action services has been
    deprecated, with the new method initAction added
    which does not get passed a scope. The allowed and
    perform method are now passed a scope for context
    in addition to the first item/items argument.
    The "scope" parameter to the WizardModalService modal()
    method has also been deprecated, and will be ignored
    in a future release of Horizon.
