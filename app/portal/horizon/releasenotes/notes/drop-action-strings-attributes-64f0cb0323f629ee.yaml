    String attributes ``action_present`` and ``action_past`` were dropped
    from ``horizon.tables.BatchAction``. ``action_present`` and ``action_past``
    *methods* are the recommended way to define action labels for BatchAction.
    The offical way allows us to define more complete strings for action labels
    and this also allows translators to translate more flexibily.
