features:
  - Added Keystone to Keystone (K2K) federation support in Horizon. If Keystone
    is configured with K2K and has service providers, the list of
    Keystone providers will appear in a dropdown. In local_settings.py you can
    optionally set the identity provider display name with
    ``KEYSTONE_PROVIDER_IDP_NAME`` or set the provider id that is used to
    compare with the other service providers ``KEYSTONE_PROVIDER_IDP_ID``.
