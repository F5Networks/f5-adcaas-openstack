  <dt translate>Parent Port</dt>
  <dd>

  <p translate>Exactly one regular Neutron port. Has to be provided when
  the trunk is created. Cannot be changed during the trunk's life.</p>

  <p translate>The parent port is the port you have to add to the instance
  at launch. Do not try to add the trunk or any of the subports to the
  instance directly.</p>

  <p translate>Inside the instance the parent port's network will always
  be presented as the untagged network. It will be available early from
  the moment of bootup.</p>

  <p translate>Note that some Neutron backends (notably the Open vSwitch
  based backend) only allow trunk creation before an instance is launched
  on the parent port.  Other backends may allow trunk creation at any
  time during the life of a port.</p>

  <p translate>Must not be the parent or a subport of any other
  trunks.</p>
