  There are two ways to generate a key pair. From a Linux system,
  generate the key pair with the <samp>ssh-keygen</samp> command:
</p>
<p>
  <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f cloud.key</code>
</p>
<p translate>
  This command generates a pair of keys: a private key (cloud.key)
  and a public key (cloud.key.pub).
</p>

  From a Windows system, you can use PuTTYGen to create private/public keys.
  Use the PuTTY Key Generator to create and save the keys, then copy
  the public key in the red highlighted box to your <samp>.ssh/authorized_keys</samp>
  file.
