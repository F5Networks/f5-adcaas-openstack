      QoS Specs can be associated with volume types.
      It is used to map to a set of quality of service capabilities requested
      by the volume owner. This is equivalent to the
      <tt>openstack volume qos create</tt> command. Once the QoS Spec gets created,
      click the "Manage Specs" button to manage the key-value specs for the QoS Spec.
      <br>
      <br>
      Each QoS Spec entity has a "Consumer" value which indicates where the
      administrator would like the QoS policy to be enforced. This value can be "front-end"
      (Compute back-end), "back-end" (Block Storage back-end), or "both".
