    A container is a storage compartment for your data and provides a way for
    you to organize your data. You can think of a container as a folder in
    Windows&reg; or a directory in UNIX&reg;. The primary difference between a
    container and these other file system concepts is that containers cannot be
    nested. You can, however, create an unlimited number of containers within
    your account. Data must be stored in a container so you must have at least
    one container defined in your account prior to uploading data.
